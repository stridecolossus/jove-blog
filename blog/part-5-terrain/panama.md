## Overview

It has always been the intention at some point to re-implement the Vulkan native layer using the FFM (Foreign Function and Memory) library developed as part of project [Panama](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/).  The reasons for delaying this rework are discussed in [code generation](/jove-blog/blog/part-1-intro/code-generation#alternatives) at the very beginning of the blog.

With the LTS release of JDK 21 the FFM library was elevated to a preview feature (rather than requiring an incubator build) and much more information and tutorials started to appear online, so it is high time to replace JNA with the more future proofed (and safer) FFM solution.

A fundamental technical decision that must be addressed immediately is whether to use the `jextract` tool to generate the _bindings_ to the native libraries or to implement a bespoke solution.  To resolve this question the tool is used to generate the Vulkan API and the results are compared and contrasted with a throwaway, hard-crafted application built using FFM from first principles.

## Design

### Exploring Panama

The GLFW library is again used as the guinea-pig since this API is relatively simple in comparison to Vulkan, which is front-loaded with complexities such as marshalling of structures, by-reference types, callbacks for diagnostic handlers, etc.

First the native library is loaded using the `SymbolLookup` service:

```java
public class DesktopForeignDemo {
    void main() {
        try(Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
            Linker linker = Linker.nativeLinker();
            SymbolLookup lookup = SymbolLookup.libraryLookup("glfw3", arena);
            var demo = new DesktopForeignDemo(lookup);
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The process of invoking a native method using FFM is:

1. Find the off-heap address of the the method via the lookup service.

2. Build a `FunctionDescriptor` specifying the signature of the method.

3. Combine both of these to link a `MethodHandle` to the native method.

4. Invoke the handle with an array of the appropriate arguments.

The GLFW library must first be initialised which returns an integer success code:

```java
MethodHandle glfwInit = linker.downcallHandle(
    lookup.find("glfwInit").orElseThrow(),
    FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT)
);
println("glfwInit=" + glfwInit.invoke());
```

The GLFW version string can now be retrieved:

```java
MethodHandle glfwGetVersionString = linker.downcallHandle(
    lookup.find("glfwGetVersionString").orElseThrow(),
    FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.ADDRESS);
);
MemorySegment versionAddress = (MemorySegment) glfwGetVersionString.invoke();
String version = versionAddress.reinterpret(Integer.MAX_VALUE).getString(0L);
println("glfwGetVersionString=" + version);
```

Notes:

* The `0L` argument in the `getString` helper is an offset into the off-heap memory.

* The returned address has to be _reinterpreted_ to expand the bounds of the off-heap memory, in this case to an undefined length for a pointer to a null-terminated character array.

Support for Vulkan can also be queried:

```java
MethodHandle glfwVulkanSupported = linker.downcallHandle(
    lookup.find("glfwVulkanSupported").orElseThrow(),
    FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.JAVA_BOOLEAN);
);
println("glfwVulkanSupported=" + glfwVulkanSupported.invoke());
```

Retrieving the supporting Vulkan extensions is slightly complex since the API method returns a pointer to a string-array and uses a _by reference_ integer to return the size of the array as a side-effect:

```java
MethodHandle glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions = linker.downcallHandle(
    lookup.find("glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions").orElseThrow(),
    FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, ValueLayout.ADDRESS);
);
MemorySegment count = arena.allocate(ValueLayout.ADDRESS);
MemorySegment extensions = (MemorySegment) glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions.invoke(count);
```

The length of the array is extracted from the by-reference argument to resize the off-heap memory:

```java
int length = count.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0L);
MemorySegment array = extensions.reinterpret(length * ValueLayout.ADDRESS.byteSize());
```

And each element is extracted and transformed to a Java string:

```java
for(int n = 0; n < length; ++n) {
    MemorySegment e = array.getAtIndex(ADDRESS, n);
    println("extension=" + e.reinterpret(Integer.MAX_VALUE).getString(0L));
}
```

Finally GLFW is closed:

```java
MethodHandle glfwTerminate = linker.downcallHandle(
    lookup.find("glfwTerminate").orElseThrow(),
    FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid()
);
glfwTerminate.invoke();
```

Note that `reinterpret` is an unsafe operation that can result in a JVM crash for an out-of-bounds array or string length, since the actual size off the off-heap memory cannot be guaranteed by the JVM.

Additionally this method is _restricted_ and will generate a runtime warning, which can be suppressed with the following VM argument:

```
--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED
```

### Analysis

Generating the FFM bindings using `jextract` is relatively trivial and takes a couple of seconds:

`jextract --source \VulkanSDK\1.2.154.1\Include\vulkan\vulkan.h`

With some experience of the FFM library and the generated Vulkan bindings, we can attempt to extrapolate how JOVE could be refactored and make some observations.

The advantages of `jextract` are obvious:

* Proven and standard JVM technology.

* Automated (in particular the FFM memory layouts for native structures).

However there are disadvantages:

* The generated API is polluted by ugly internals such as field handles, structure sizes, helper methods, etc.

* API methods and structures can only be defined in terms of FFM types or primitives (resulting in poor type safety and loss of meaning).

* Enumerations are implemented as static integer accessors (WTF!) 

* Implies throwing away the existing code generated enumerations and structures.

Alternatively an abstraction layer based on the existing hand-crafted API and code-generated classes would have the following advantages:

* The native API and structures are expressed in domain terms.

* Proper enumerations.

* Retains the existing API and code-generated enumerations and structures.

On the other hand:

* Substantial development effect.

* Proprietary solution with the potential for unknown problems further down the line.

* Memory layouts needs to be generated for _all_ structures.

Despite the advantages of `jextract` the hybrid solution is clearly preferable - the ugly bindings, lack of type safety, etc. were the very concerns that led us to abandon LWJGL in the first place.

> In any case the application and/or JOVE would _still_ need to transform domain types to/from the FFM equivalents even if `jextract` was used to generate the underlying bindings.

The source code generated by `jextract` will be retained as it will be a useful resource during development, particularly for the memory layout of structures.

### Requirements

With this decision made (for better or worse) the requirements are determined as the following:

* A mechanism that generates an FFM-based implementation of the existing GLFW and Vulkan API definitions.

* A _marshalling_ framework that transforms supported Java types to/from the FFM equivalents.

* Support for by-reference parameters.

* Support for callbacks for GLFW device polling and the Vulkan diagnostics handler.

* Refactoring of the code generator to build the FFM memory layout for all structures.

The marshalling framework will need to support the following types:

* primitives

* strings

* structures

* domain types, i.e. reference types such as `Handle` or subclasses of `NativeObject`

* integer enumerations and bitfields

* arrays of these supported types.

From these requirements the following observations can be made concerning some of the trickier aspects:

1. For the moment at least it seems logical to continue to treat by-reference integers and pointers as special cases.  They are already integral to JOVE (based on the existing JNA equivalents) and in particular there is no Java analog for a by-reference integer.

2. The other by-reference use-cases imply some form of post-processing to 'copy' the off-heap memory back to the argument(s).

3. GLFW makes heavy use of callbacks for device polling which will require substantial factoring to use FFM upcall stubs.

4. The `glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions` method is an edge-case (for reasons detailed later) and is also the only method in either library that returns an array, therefore this requirement is deferred for the moment and the Vulkan extensions are temporarily hard-coded.

### Design

From the above the following framework component are identified:

* A _native library builder_ responsible for constructing the FFM implementation of a native API expressed in domain terms.

* A set of _transformers_ for the supported types responsible for off-heap memory allocation and marshalling to/from the equivalent FFM representation.

* A _native method_ class that composes an FFM method handle and the transformers for its parameters and optional return type.

* A mechanism to identify by-reference parameters and logic to unmarshal these parameters _after_ method invocation.

Additionally there are some offline tasks to be completed:

* Removal of the JNA library.

* A global find-and-replace to refactor the GLFW and Vulkan APIs in terms of the new framework.

* Automated generation of the FFM memory layouts for the Vulkan structures.

A 'big bang' approach always feels inherently risky simply due to the shear scale of the changes to be made.  Therefore the plan is to create a throwaway prototype targeted at a cut-down API (again using GLFW to begin with) such that we can focus on the development of the new framework without getting bogged down in compilation issues.  Once this is up and running _then_ we will integrate the code into JOVE and iteratively reintroduce each component and refactor accordingly.

As already noted, Vulkan is very front-loaded with complexity, so framework support will be implemented as we progress.  Once we are confident that the bulk of the challenges facing the new framework have been addressed, the prototype will be discarded and refactoring can continue with the existing suite of demo applications.

## Framework

### Native Library

The logical starting point is the factory class that builds a native library.

This involves the following steps:

1. Enumerate the native methods from the user defined API.

2. Create and link an FFM method handle for each identified API method.

3. Create a Java proxy that delegates API calls to the underlying FFM methods.

This process is implemented as follows:

```java
public class NativeLibraryBuilder {
    private final SymbolLookup lookup;

    public <T> T build(Class<T> api) {
        if(!api.isInterface()) throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);
        Map<Method, NativeMethod> methods = methods(api);
        return proxy(api, methods);
    }
}
```

Where _api_ is the user defined interface specifying the API to be implemented.

The `NativeMethod` class is a wrapper for the resultant FFM handle:

```java
public class NativeMethod {
    private MemoryHandle handle;
    
    public Object invoke(Object[] args) {
        return handle.invokeWithArguments(args);
    }
}
```

The API methods are enumerated by reflecting the API and building a wrapper for each native method:

```java
private Map<Method, NativeMethod> methods(Class<?> api) {
    return Arrays
        .stream(api.getMethods())
        .filter(NativeLibraryBuilder::isNativeMethod)
        .collect(toMap(Function.identity(), this::build));
}
```

Where a native method is defined as a public, non-static method of the API:

```java
private static boolean isNativeMethod(Method method) {
    int modifiers = method.getModifiers();
    return !Modifier.isStatic(modifiers);
}
```

The overloaded `build` method finds the symbol (i.e. the off-heap address) of the method by name and temporarily creates an empty wrapper:

```java
public NativeMethod build(Method method) {
    MemorySegment address = lookup.find(method.getName()).orElseThrow(...);                
    return new NativeMethod(...);
}
```

Next an _invocation handler_ is created that delegates Java method calls to the underlying native method:

```java
private <T> T proxy(Class<T> api, Map<Method, NativeMethod> methods) {
    var handler = new InvocationHandler() {
        public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
            NativeMethod delegate = methods.get(method);
            return delegate.invoke(args);
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

From which a Java proxy is created:

```java
ClassLoader loader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
return (T) Proxy.newProxyInstance(loader, new Class<?>[]{api}, handler);
```

This returns an implementation of the user-defined API that transparently delegates method calls to the underlying native library.  Cool.

### Native Method

Building a native method requires the parameter signature and return type in order to link the FFM method handle.  Looking ahead we will also need to construct native methods programatically (i.e. not using reflection) for the diagnostics handler and possibly other use cases.  Therefore this class will be agnostic to the source of the method signature and the library symbol.

First a builder is added to construct a native method:

```java
public static class Builder {
    private final Linker linker = Linker.nativeLinker();
    private MemorySegment address;
    private Class<?> returns;
    private final List<Class<?>> signature = new ArrayList<>();
}
```

Construction of the native method handle requires the symbol and an FFM function descriptor.  First the memory layout of the method is derived from the signature:

```java
public NativeMethod build() {
    MemoryLayout[] layouts = Arrays
        .stream(signature)
        .map(NativeLibraryBuilder::layout)
        .toArray(MemoryLayout[]::new);
        
    ...
}
```

Where `layout` is a temporary, quick-and-dirty mapper that just supports the integer primitives needed for a basic GLFW demonstration:

```java
private static MemoryLayout layout(Class<?> type) {
    if(type == int.class) {
        return ValueLayout.JAVA_INT;
    }
    else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);
    }
}
```

Next the function descriptor is derived from the memory layout and the optional return type:

```java
private static FunctionDescriptor descriptor(Class<?> returns, MemoryLayout[] layout) {
    FunctionDescriptor descriptor = FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid(layouts);

    if(returns == null) || (returns == void.class)) {
        return descriptor;
    }
    else {
        return descriptor.changeReturnLayout(layout(returns));
    }
}
```

And finally the method handle is linked to the native library:

```java
public NativeMethod build() {
    MemoryLayout[] layout = ...
    FunctionDescriptor descriptor = descriptor(returns, layout);
    MethodHandle handle = linker.downcallHandle(descriptor).bindTo(address);
    return new NativeMethod(handle);
}
```

The factory can now be updated to configure and build a native method wrapper for each API method:

``` java
public NativeMethod build(Method method) {
    MemorySegment address = ...

    var builder = new NativeMethod.Builder()
        .address(address)
        .returns(method.getReturnType());

    for(Parameter p : method.getParameters()) {
        builder.parameter(p.getType());
    }

    return builder.build();
}
```

### Integration #1

To exercise the new framework a second prototype is created to test GLFW, using the following (very) cut-down API dependant only on integer primitives:

```java
interface API {
    int         glfwInit();
    void        glfwTerminate();
    int         glfwVulkanSupported();
    //String    glfwGetVersionString();
    //String[]  glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions(&int count);
}
```

A proxy implementation is generated using the new factory:

```java
try(Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var lookup = SymbolLookup.libraryLookup("glfw3", arena);
    var factory = new NativeLibraryBuilder(lookup);
    API api = factory.build(API.class);
    ...
}
```

Which can then be invoked to test a few basic GLFW methods:

```java
System.out.println("init=" + api.glfwInit());
System.out.println("Vulkan=" + api.glfwVulkanSupported());
api.glfwTerminate();
```

To summarise, the new framework:

* Maps and links the user-defined API methods to the native library.

* Maps the domain type of the parameters and the return value to the equivalent FFM memory layout (albeit only for primitive integers so far).

* Transparently delegates API calls to the underlying native methods.

### Native Transformer

With the basic framework in place the next step is to implement support for the remaining primitives and Java reference types, such that the API can be expressed in domain terms.

The first attempt used the functionality provided by the `MethodHandle` class (used extensively in FFM) which supports transformation of the incoming arguments and the method return value.  This initially seemed a perfect fit, however in practice the code became convoluted very quickly.  The logic required to mutate an argument is generally also implemented as 'target' method handles, resulting in fiddly lookup and binding code for all but the most trivial cases.

After some time we abandoned this approach in favour of pre/post-processing the arguments around invocation of the native method.  The code became much clearer and easier to unit-test, at the expense of some additional processing.  Of importance is error cases can still be trapped when the native method is being constructed.

> As it turns out some form of pre/post-processing would probably have been needed anyway, since it hard to envisage how by-reference parameters could be implemented solely using the `MethodHandle` class.

The second attempt started with the concept of an argument _transformer_ responsible for marshalling a Java type to its FFM equivalent:

```java
public interface Transformer<T> {
    /**
     * @return Memory layout of this type
     */
    default MemoryLayout layout() {
        return ValueLayout.ADDRESS;
    }

    /**
     * Marshals an argument to its native representation.
     * @param arg           Argument
     * @param allocator     Off-heap allocator
     * @return Native argument
     */
    Object marshal(T arg, SegmentAllocator allocator);
    
    /**
     * Provides a transformer to unmarshal a native return value of this type.
     * @return Unmarshalling function
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this type cannot logically be returned from a native method
     */
    Function<? extends Object, T> unmarshal();
}
```

Not all types can logically be returned from the native layer, hence the `unmarshal` method returns a function that transforms a native value to the corresponding Java type.

The native method class can now be refactored in terms of transformers rather than types:

```java
public class NativeMethod {
    private final MethodHandle handle;
    private final Transformer returns;
    private final Transformer[] signature;
}
```

Method arguments are marshalled before invocation:

```java
private Object[] marshal(Object[] args) {
    var allocator = Arena.ofAuto();
    Object[] transformed = new Object[args.length];
    for(int n = 0; n < args.length; ++n) {
        transformed[n] = signature[n].marshal(args[n], allocator);
    }
    return transformed;
}
```

And similarly for the return value:

```java
private Object unmarshal(Object result) {
    if(returns == null) {
        return null;
    }
    else {
        return returns.unmarshal().apply(result);
    }
}
```

### Registry

Next the following new component is introduced that manages transformers for the supported types, which for the moment is essentially a simple map:

```java
public class Registry {
    private final Map<Class<?>, Transformer<?>> registry = new HashMap<>();

    /**
     * Looks up or creates the native transformer for the given domain type.
     * @param type Domain type
     * @return Native transformer
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the type is not supported
     */
    public Transformer<?> transformer(Class<?> type) {
        final Transformer<?> transformer = registry.get(type);
        if(transformer == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);
        return transformer;
    }

    /**
     * Registers a native transformer for the given type.
     * @param <T> Domain type
     * @param type              Java or domain type
     * @param transformer       Native transformer
     */
    public <T> void add(Class<T> type, Transformer<? extends T> transformer) {
        registry.put(type, transformer);
    }
}
```

The builder for a native method is refactored to lookup the relevant transformers for the method parameters and return type:

```java
public static class Builder {
    private final Registry registry;
    ...
    private Transformer<?> returns;
    private List<Transformer<?> signature = new ArrayList<>();

    public Builder returns(Class<?> type) {
        this.returns = registry.transformer(type);
        return this;
    }

    public Builder parameter(Class<?> type) {
        Transformer<?> transformer = registry.transformer(type);
        signature.add(transformer);
        return this;
    }
}

```

And the function descriptor is now derived from the transformers:

```java
private FunctionDescriptor descriptor() {
    // Map method signature to FFM layout
    MemoryLayout[] layouts = signature
        .stream()
        .map(Transformer::layout)
        .toArray(MemoryLayout[]::new);

    // Init descriptor
    FunctionDescriptor descriptor = FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid(layouts);

    // Append return layout
    if(returns == null) {
        return descriptor;
    }
    else {
        return descriptor.changeReturnLayout(returns.layout());
    }
}
```

### Implementation

The following sections cover support for some of the remaining use-cases that can be easily refactored into the new framework.

#### String

String values are supported by the following companion transformer:

```java
public class StringTransformer implements Transformer<String> {
    public MemorySegment marshal(String str, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
        return allocator.allocateFrom(str);
    }

    public Function<MemorySegment, String> unmarshal() {
        return StringTransformer::unmarshal;
    }

    public static String unmarshal(MemorySegment address) {
        return address.reinterpret(Integer.MAX_VALUE).getString(0L);
    }
}
```

The `allocateFrom` helper method is used to allocate the off-heap memory for a given string.

#### Domain Types

The JOVE `Handle` is reimplemented as an opaque, immutable wrapper for an FFM pointer:

```java
public final class Handle {
    private final MemorySegment address;

    public Handle(MemorySegment address) {
        this.address = address.asReadOnly();
    }

    public MemorySegment address() {
        return MemorySegment.ofAddress(address.address());
    }
}
```

With a companion transformer:

```java
public static class HandleTransformer implements Transformer<Handle> {
    public MemorySegment marshal(Handle arg, SegmentAllocator _) {
        return arg.address;
    }

    public Handle unmarshal(MemorySegment address) {
        return new Handle(address);
    }
}
```

And similarly for JOVE domain types:

```java
public interface NativeObject {
    Handle handle();

    public static class NativeObjectTransformer implements Transformer<NativeObject> {
        public MemorySegment marshal(NativeObject arg, SegmentAllocator _) {
            return arg.handle().address();
        }

        public NativeObject unmarshal(MemorySegment address) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
        }
    }
}
```

Note that in this case the `unmarshal` method is disallowed since a JOVE object will never be returned from the native layer.

To support custom JOVE and domain types that inherit from `NativeObject` the registry class is refactored:

```java
public Transformer<?> transformer(Class<?> type) {
    Transformer<?> transformer = registry.get(type);

    if(transformer == null) {
        Transformer created = derive(type);
        add(type, created);
        return created;
    }
    else {
        return transformer;
    }
}
```

The `derive` method scans the registry for an available transformer with an suitable supertype:

```java
private Transformer derive(Class<?> type) {
    return registry
        .keySet()
        .stream()
        .filter(e -> e.isAssignableFrom(type))
        .findAny()
        .map(registry::get)
        .orElseThrow(...);
```

Note that the mapping to the supertype transformer is registered as a side-effect.

#### Native Reference

As outlined above, the commonly used by-reference types (integer and pointer) will continue to be handled as special cases.

The following new template class encapsulates an off-heap pointer and an accessor for the referenced value:

```java
public abstract class NativeReference<T> {
    protected MemorySegment pointer;

    /**
     * @return Referenced value
     */
    public abstract T get();
}
```

The companion transformer marshals a native reference:

```java
public static class NativeReferenceTransformer implements Transformer<NativeReference<?>> {
    public MemorySegment marshal(NativeReference<?> ref, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
        return ref.allocate(allocator);
    }

    public Function<MemorySegment, NativeReference<?>> unmarshal() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }
}
```

Where the `allocate` method creates the off-heap pointer on demand:

```java
private MemorySegment allocate(SegmentAllocator allocator) {
    if(pointer == null) {
        pointer = allocator.allocate(ValueLayout.ADDRESS);
    }

    return pointer;
}
```

Native references are instantiated by the following replacement for the existing factory:

```java
public static class Factory {
    public NativeReference<Integer> integer() {
        ...
    }

    public NativeReference<Handle> pointer() {
        ...
    }
}
```

As a reminder, the main reason for having a separate factory class is that it can easily be mocked for testing purposes.

The by-reference integer implementation extracts the value from the off-heap pointer:

```java
public NativeReference<Integer> integer() {
    return new NativeReference<>() {
        public Integer get() {
            if(pointer == null) {
                return 0;
            }
            else {
                return pointer.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0);
            }
        }
    };
}
```

And similarly for a by-reference pointer, implemented as a `Handle` wrapper:

```java
public NativeReference<Handle> pointer() {
    return new NativeReference<>() {
        public Handle get() {
            if(pointer == null) {
                return null;
            }
            else {
                MemorySegment address = pointer.get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, 0);
                return new Handle(address);
            }
        }
    };
}
```

#### Primitives

Primitive values do not require any transformation and are marshalled as-is:

```java
public record IdentityTransformer<T>(ValueLayout layout) implements Transformer<T> {
    public Object marshal(Object arg, SegmentAllocator _) {
        return arg;
    }

    public Function<?, T> unmarshal() {
        return Function.identity();
    }
}
```

The built-in primitives supported by FFM are registered by the following helper:

```java
public static void primitives(Registry registry) {
    ValueLayout[] primitives = {
        JAVA_BOOLEAN,
        JAVA_BYTE,
        JAVA_CHAR,
        JAVA_SHORT,
        JAVA_INT,
        JAVA_LONG,
        JAVA_FLOAT,
        JAVA_DOUBLE
    };

    for(ValueLayout layout : primitives) {
        var transformer = new IdentityTransformer<>(layout);
        Class carrier = layout.carrier();
        registry.add(carrier, transformer);
    }
}
```

### Integration #2

The GLFW library is now fully supported by the new framework other than the following cases which are deferred until later:

* Callback support for GLFW devices is temporarily hacked out.

* The `glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions` edge case is hard-coded for the moment.

Refactoring of the `Desktop` service resulted in the following:

```java
public static Desktop create() {
    // Build GLFW library
    var registry = DefaultRegistry.create();
    var factory = new NativeLibraryBuilder("glfw3", registry);
    DesktopLibrary lib = factory.build(DesktopLibrary.class);

    // Init GLFW
    int result = lib.glfwInit();
    if(result != 1) throw new RuntimeException(...);

    // Create desktop service
    return new Desktop(lib, new NativeReference.Factory());
}
```

The `DefaultRegistry` is a convenience utility class that creates a registry supporting commonly used types:

```java
public static Registry create() {
    // Create registry
    Registry registry = new Registry();

    // Primitives
    IdentityTransformer.primitives(registry);

    // Common types
    registry.add(String.class, new StringTransformer());
    registry.add(NativeReference.class, new NativeReferenceTransformer());

    // JOVE types
    registry.add(Handle.class, new HandleTransformer());
    registry.add(NativeObject.class, new NativeObjectTransformer());

    return registry;
}
```

The prototype is similarly refactored and extended to the point where the application window is created:

```java
void main() throws Exception {
    var desktop = Desktop.create();
    System.out.println(desktop.version());
    System.out.println(desktop.isVulkanSupported());

    Window window = new Window.Builder()
        .title("Prototype")
        .size(new Dimensions(1024, 768))
        .hint(Hint.CLIENT_API, 0)
        .hint(Hint.VISIBLE, 0)
        .build(desktop);
        
    desktop.terminate();
}
```

## Structures

### Overview

At this point we feel confident that the framework is ready to support Vulkan, with a few required workarounds:

* The code-generator will require significant rework to remove JNA and generate the FFM memory layouts of the structures.  For the moment we prefer to defer this work until the bulk of the refactoring has been completed.  In the meantime some text editor magic is used to remove the JNA dependencies and the structure layouts will be hand-crafted as required.

* The new framework builds and validates the _whole_ API at instantiation-time.  Therefore both the GLFW and Vulkan APIs are cut back to the bare minimum and the methods will be gradually reintroduced as we progress.

* The deferred GLFW requirements listed above.

Remarkably this refactoring work went much more smoothly than anticipated, with only a handful of compilation problems.  Apparently the existing JOVE code did a decent job of abstracting over JNA.

### Framework

The approach from this point is to add Vulkan to the prototype and tackle each JOVE component in order starting with the `Instance` domain object.  This requires implementing marshalling support for native structures, the main subject of this section.  However there are various tidying tasks and a few framework enhancements to be implemented first.

#### Vulkan Service

As a quick diversion, the following new type is introduced to compose the various top-level Vulkan components that were previously separate fields of the instance:

```java
public class Vulkan {
    private final VulkanLibrary lib;
    private final Registry registry;
    private final NativeReference.Factory factory;
}
```

With a `create` method to instantiate the library:

```java
public static Vulkan create() {
    var registry = DefaultRegistry.create();
    var factory = new NativeLibraryBuilder("vulkan-1", registry);
    var lib = factory.build(VulkanLibrary.class);
    return new Vulkan(lib, registry, new NativeReference.Factory());
}
```

This follows the same pattern as GLFW above and neatly replaces the existing method in the `VulkanLibrary` interface, which had become a bit of dumping ground for helper methods and constants.

#### Return Handler

The approach of using a proxy enables the new framework to validate _all_ Vulkan return codes in one location, whereas previously _every_ native call had to be wrapped with the `check` helper method which was ugly and slightly tedious.

First a handler for return values is added to the factory:

```java
public class NativeLibraryBuilder {
    private Consumer<Object> check = result -> {};
}
```

The invocation handler simply delegates return values to the configured handler after invocation:

```java
var handler = new InvocationHandler() {
    public Object invoke(...) {
        ...
        Object result = ...
        check.accept(result);
        return result;
    }
};
```

For convenience a specialised integer handler can be configured:

```java
public void setIntegerReturnHandler(IntConsumer handler) {
    Consumer<Object> wrapper = result -> {
        if(result instanceof Integer code) {
            handler.accept(code);
        }
    };
    setReturnHandler(wrapper);
}
```

Which is integrated into the Vulkan implementation accordingly:

```java
public static Vulkan create() {
    ...
    var factory = new NativeLibraryBuilder(registry);
    factory.setIntegerReturnHandler(Vulkan::check);
    ...
}
```

Nice.

#### Empty Values

The framework now supports reference types that could legitimately be `null` for an unused or empty value, which FFM represents with the `MemorySegment.NULL` constant.

An `empty` value is added to the definition of the transformer:

```java
interface Transformer {
    default Object empty() {
        return MemorySegment.NULL;
    }
}
```

And a convenience helper is also added that switches behaviour accordingly:

```java
static Object marshal(Object arg, Transformer transformer, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
    if(arg == null) {
        return transformer.empty();
    }
    else {
        return transformer.marshal(arg, allocator);
    }
}
```

#### Enumerations

Both of the structures used to create the Vulkan instance are dependant on integer enumerations which requires the implementation of another companion transformer:

```java
class IntEnumTransformer implements Transformer<IntEnum> {
    private final ReverseMapping<?> mapping;

    public MemoryLayout layout() {
        return ValueLayout.JAVA_INT;
    }

    public Integer empty() {
        return mapping.defaultValue().value();
    }

    public Integer marshal(IntEnum e, SegmentAllocator _) {
        return e.value();
    }

    public Function<Integer, IntEnum> unmarshal() {
        return value -> {
            if(value == 0) {
                return mapping.defaultValue();
            }
            else {
                return mapping.map(value);
            }
        };
    }
}
```

Note that the return type and `empty` values are native integers in this case.

The transformer for an enumeration bitfield is refactored similarly:

```java
public static class EnumMaskTransformer implements Transformer<EnumMask<?>> {
    public MemoryLayout layout() {
        return ValueLayout.JAVA_INT;
    }

    public Integer marshal(EnumMask<?> mask, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
        return mask.bits;
    }

    public Integer empty() {
        return 0;
    }

    public Function<Integer, EnumMask<?>> unmarshal() {
        return EnumMask::new;
    }
}
```

The new transformer for an `IntEnum` is specific to a given enumeration class (i.e. for the reverse mapping) which implies an intermediate mechanism to generate a transformer for a given subclass (as opposed to a singleton that handles _all_ instances of that class).  This mechanism will also be required shortly for structures which will be similarly class-specific.

Therefore the registry is extended to configure _transformer factories_ that are responsible for generating new transformers as required:

```java
public class Registry {
    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface Factory<T> {
        /**
         * Creates a new transformer for the given type.
         * @param type Domain type
         * @return Transformer
         */
        Transformer<T> create(Class<? extends T> type);
    }

    private final Map<Class<?>, Factory<?>> factories = new HashMap<>();

    public <T> void add(Class<T> type, Factory<T> factory) {
        factories.put(type, factory);
    }
}
```

The process of creating a transformer for a given type is now extended accordingly:

```java
private Transformer<?> find(Class<?> type) {
    return create(type)
        .or(() -> derive(type))
        .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException(...));
}
```

Where the `create` method instantiates a new transformer if it is supported by a configured factory:

```java
private Optional<Transformer<?>> create(Class<?> type) {
    return factories
        .keySet()
        .stream()
        .filter(e -> e.isAssignableFrom(type))
        .findAny()
        .map(factories::get)
        .map(factory -> factory.create(type));
}
```

In summary the process of determining the transformer for a given type now becomes:

1. Lookup the existing registered transformer if present.

2. Create a new transformer from the relevant factory if one matches.

3. Derive from a registered transformer if there is a suitable supertype present.

4. Otherwise the type is not supported.

Possible future enhancements:

* The mechanism to `derive` a supertype transformer could probably be encapsulated into a separate transformer factory.

* A factory is currently matched by class type, this may be expanded to a general predicate later if required.

#### Structures

To support structures the following replacement definition is introduced that provides the FFM memory layout:

```java
public interface NativeStructure {
    /**
     * @return Memory layout of this structure
     */
    StructLayout layout();
}
```

A companion factory generates a new transformer instance for a given structure as required:

```java
class StructureTransformerFactory implements Registry.Factory<NativeStructure> {
    public Transformer<NativeStructure> create(Class<? extends NativeStructure> type) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Which for the moment does nothing other than allocate the off-heap memory:

```java
return new Transformer<>() {
    private final StructLayout layout = mappings.layout();

    public MemorySegment marshal(NativeStructure structure, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
        MemorySegment address = allocator.allocate(layout);
        ...
        return address;
    }

    public Function<MemorySegment, NativeStructure> unmarshal() {
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Arrays

Arrays are the final type that is missing from marshalling framework, will be required for the extensions and validation layers of the Vulkan instance.

The following new implementation composes a transformer that marshals the _component type_ of the array:

```java
public class ArrayTransformer<T> implements Transformer<T[]> {
    private final Transformer<T> transformer;

    public MemoryLayout layout() {
        return ValueLayout.ADDRESS;
    }

    public MemorySegment marshal(T[] array, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
        ...
        return address;
    }
    
    public Function<?, T[]> unmarshal() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }
}
```

The `marshal` method first allocates the off-heap memory as a contiguous block given the layout of the component:

```java
MemoryLayout layout = transformer.layout();
MemorySegment address = allocator.allocate(layout, array.length);
```

Next a _var handle_ is created to access the elements of the array:

```java
var handle = Transformer.removeOffset(layout.arrayElementVarHandle());
```

And each element is transformed and written to the off-heap memory using the handle:

```java
for(int n = 0; n < array.length; ++n) {
    Object element = Transformer.marshal(array[n], transformer, allocator);
    handle.set(address, (long) n, element);
}
```

The handle is essentially the same as using the various mutator methods on the `MemorySegment` class but is more convenient in this case.

Whilst this class is public and can be used directly by the application (if required) it seems logical that an array of a supported type should also be automatically marshalled.

The `find` method of the registry is modified to treat arrays as a special case:

```java
private Transformer<?> find(Class<?> type) {
    if(type.isArray()) {
        return array(type);
    }
    ...
}        
```

Which creates and automatically registers an array transformer for a given component type:

```java
private Transformer<?> array(Class<?> type) {
    Transformer<?> component = find(type.getComponentType());
    Transformer transformer = new ArrayTransformer<>(component);
    add(type, transformer);
    return transformer;
}
```

This will allow extensions and validation layers to be configured as string-arrays in the revised instance structure below.

Note that for the moment this implementation only supports arrays of reference types (e.g. an array of strings or handles).  Additional functionality will be introduced later to handle arrays of structures and primitives which have further constraints.

### Integration #3

The `Instance` domain class can now be refactored with the following temporary fiddles:

* The `VulkanLibrary` is cut down to just the instance methods

* The diagnostics handler is temporarily removed.

* Similarly for the `function` method that retrieves the function pointers for handlers.

The instance library now looks like this:

```java
interface Library {
    int     vkCreateInstance(VkInstanceCreateInfo pCreateInfo, Handle pAllocator, NativeReference<Handle> pInstance);
    void    vkDestroyInstance(Instance instance, Handle pAllocator);
    int     vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(String pLayerName, NativeReference<Integer> pPropertyCount, @Returned VkExtensionProperties[] pProperties);
    int     vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties(IntegerReference pPropertyCount, @Returned VkLayerProperties[] pProperties);
    Handle  vkGetInstanceProcAddr(Instance instance, String pName);
}
```

Notes:

* Array parameters are now explicitly specified as Java arrays.  Previously these were declared as a __single__ instance since JNA mandated that a contiguous block was represented by the __first__ element of an array.

* The `@Returned` annotation denotes parameters that are returned by-reference (handled later in this chapter).

After the text editor fiddling mentioned above the instance descriptor now looks like this:

```java
public class VkInstanceCreateInfo implements NativeStructure {
    public final VkStructureType sType = VkStructureType.INSTANCE_CREATE_INFO;
    public Handle pNext;
    public int flags;
    public VkApplicationInfo pApplicationInfo;
    public int enabledLayerCount;
    public String[] ppEnabledLayerNames;
    public int enabledExtensionCount;
    public String[] ppEnabledExtensionNames;
}
```

With the following memory layout:

```java
public StructLayout layout() {
    return MemoryLayout.structLayout(
        JAVA_INT.withName("sType"),
        PADDING,
        POINTER.withName("pNext"),
        JAVA_INT.withName("flags"),
        PADDING,
        POINTER.withName("pApplicationInfo"),
        JAVA_INT.withName("enabledLayerCount"),
        PADDING,
        POINTER.withName("ppEnabledLayerNames"),
        JAVA_INT.withName("enabledExtensionCount"),
        PADDING,
        POINTER.withName("ppEnabledExtensionNames")
    );
}
```

The convenience `POINTER` constant defines a native pointer to other structures, strings, variable-length arrays, etc:

```java
public interface NativeStructure {
    AddressLayout POINTER = ValueLayout.ADDRESS.withTargetLayout(MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(Integer.MAX_VALUE, ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE));
}
```

And `PADDING` is used to align fields to the word size of a native structure (8 bytes by default):

```java
MemoryLayout PADDING = MemoryLayout.paddingLayout(4);
```

The layout for the application details descriptor is as follows:

```java
public StructLayout layout() {
    return MemoryLayout.structLayout(
        JAVA_INT.withName("sType"),
        PADDING,
        POINTER.withName("pNext"),
        POINTER.withName("pApplicationName"),
        JAVA_INT.withName("applicationVersion"),
        PADDING,
        POINTER.withName("pEngineName"),
        JAVA_INT.withName("engineVersion"),
        PADDING,
        JAVA_INT.withName("apiVersion"),
        PADDING
    );
}
```

Notes:

* These layouts are copied from the code generated by the `jextract` tool earlier.

* The JOVE code generator will need to track the byte alignment of each structure and inject padding as required.

* The `layout` is temporarily made a `default` method (throwing an exception) to allow the remaining structures to compile without errors.

* The extensions and validation layers are now defined as string-arrays which will be automatically handled by the array transformer.

> We considered completely overhauling native structures by code-generating builders (as LWJGL does) to replace the fully mutable public fields.  However since structures are generally only used internally as data carriers the effort seems to outweigh any benefit of the better encapsulation.  Additionally all existing code that used structures would need to be __manually__ refactored which would be tedious.

The prototype can now be extended to instantiate Vulkan and configure the instance:

```java
Vulkan vulkan = Vulkan.create();

Instance instance = new Instance.Builder()
    .name("Prototype")
    .extension("VK_EXT_debug_utils")
    .layer(ValidationLayer.STANDARD_VALIDATION)
    .build(vulkan);
```

This code compiles and runs but does nothing since we are not actually populating the structures.

### Field Mapping

The process of marshalling a structure field is:

1. Retrieve the value of the field from the structure.

2. Apply the transformer.

3. Set the transformed field in the off-heap memory.

This is implemented by a new _field mapping_ type:

```java
record FieldMapping(VarHandle local, VarHandle foreign, Transformer<?> transformer) {
    public void marshal(NativeStructure structure, MemorySegment address, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
        Object value = local.get(structure);
        Object arg = Transformer.marshal(value, transformer, allocator);
        foreign.set(address, arg);
    }
}
```

Where `field` and `foreign` are handles to the structure field and off-heap field respectively.

Marshalling a structure is simply a matter of iterating over a list of field mappings:

```java
record StructureMapping(StructLayout layout, List<FieldMapping> fields) {
    public void marshal(NativeStructure structure, MemorySegment address, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
        for(var f : fields) {
            f.marshal(structure, address, allocator);
        }
    }
}
```

Notes:

* Unmarshalling of structures is handled below when the diagnostic handler is integrated.

* Pointers to other structures (e.g. the `pApplicationInfo` field of the instance descriptor) are automatically handled by this mechanism recursively, since a field mapping composes a transformer which can also marshal structures.

It is worth considering that the `marshal` method allocates and populates the off-heap memory on _every_ invocation, with the memory being discarded afterwards.  A future enhancement _could_ cache and reuse the memory address and implement some sort of synchronisation mechanism (which is the JNA approach), but this would be quite complex and is not required for the forseeable future.  In reality native structures only have scope during marshalling, therefore the simpler approach seems more palatable.

### Builder

The `StructureTransformerFactory` above delegates to the following new component to build the field mappings for a given structure:

```java
class Builder {
    private final Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
    private final Registry registry;

    public StructureMapping build(Class<? extends NativeStructure> type) {
    }
}
```

The `build` method first creates an instance of the structure which is used to retrieve its FFM memory layout:

```java
NativeStructure instance = type.getConstructor().newInstance();
StructLayout layout = instance.layout();
```

Notes:

* This implies that every native structure __must__ expose a default constructor, a common constraint for a marshalling framework.

* Exception handling has been omitted and helper methods silently inlined for brevity.

The builder delegates to a helper class to construct the mappings:

```java
var helper = new Helper(type, layout);
List<FieldMapping> mappings = helper.build();
return new StructureMapping(layout, mappings);
```

The helper iterates over the members of the memory layout:

```java
public List<FieldMapping> build() {
    return layout
        .memberLayouts()
        .stream()
        .filter(Predicate.not(e -> e instanceof PaddingLayout))
        .map(this::mapping)
        .toList();
}
```

Each structure field is looked via reflection by the name declared in the memory layout:

```java
private FieldMapping mapping(MemoryLayout member) {
    String name = member.name().orElseThrow();
    Field field = type.getField(name);
    ...
}
```

The _local_ handle is created from the reflected field:

```java
VarHandle local = lookup.unreflectVarHandle(field);
```

And the _foreign_ (or off-heap) handle is created from the memory layout:

```java
PathElement path = PathElement.groupElement(field.getName());
VarHandle foreign = Transformer.removeOffset(layout.varHandle(path));
```

Modifying the off-heap field requires a byte offset argument (a _coordinate_ in FFM terms) even though this value is almost always zero.  The `removeOffset` method is a convenience helper that initialises this argument once:

```java
public static VarHandle removeOffset(VarHandle handle) {
    return MethodHandles.insertCoordinates(handle, 1, 0L);
}
```

Finally the handles and transformer are composed into the field mapping:

```java
Transformer<?> transformer = registry.transformer(field.getType());
return new FieldMapping(local, foreign, transformer);
```

The structure layout conveniently specifies the order of the fields _explicitly_ since it must obviously exactly match the native representation (including alignment).  This is unlike reflection where the order is arbitrary, hence there is no need for something like the `@FieldOrder` annotation that was required for JNA structures.

In the prototype the Vulkan instance should now be successfully instantiated and configured using the new framework.  A lot of work to get to the stage JOVE was at several years previously.

### Unmarshalling

To reduce the chance of breaking something the diagnostics handler will be reintroduced before progressing further.  This requires _unmarshalling_ of the diagnostic report which neatly completes the framework for structures.

#### Diagnostic Handler

Refactoring the diagnostic handler presents a few new challenges:

* The native methods to create and destroy a handler must be created programatically, since the address is a _function pointer_ instead of a symbol looked up from the native library.

* In particular the method signatures are not defined in the Vulkan API but must be derived from the documentation.

* A handler requires an FFM callback _stub_ to allow Vulkan to report diagnostic messages to the application.

* Ideally any changes will reuse the existing framework.

The majority of the existing handler code remains as-is except for:

* Invocation of the create and destroy function pointers.

* Creation of the message callback.

* Unmarshalling of the diagnostic report structure to construct the `Message` record.

First the `function` method of the `Instance` is reintroduced, which turns out to be trivial:

```java
public Handle function(String name) {
    Handle handle = vulkan.library().vkGetInstanceProcAddr(this, name);
    if(handle == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);
    return handle;
}
```

This is used to retrieve the function pointer to create the handler:

```java
private Handle create(VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT info) {
    Handle function = instance.function("vkCreateDebugUtilsMessengerEXT");
    ...
}
```

A native method is constructed for the create method:

```java
NativeMethod create = new NativeMethod.Builder(registry)
    .address(function.address())
    .returns(int.class)
    .parameter(Instance.class)
    .parameter(VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT.class)
    .parameter(Handle.class)
    .parameter(PointerReference.class)
    .build();
```

Which is invoked with the relevant arguments to create the handler:

```java
NativeReference<Handle> ref = instance.vulkan().factory().pointer();
Object[] args = {instance, info, null, ref};
Vulkan.check((int) create.invoke(args));
return ref.get();
```

The handler is destroyed in a similar fashion:

```java
protected void release() {
    // Lookup the function pointer
    Handle function = instance.function("vkDestroyDebugUtilsMessengerEXT");

    // Build the native method
    NativeTransformerRegistry registry = ...
    NativeMethod destroy = new NativeMethod.Builder(registry)
        .address(function.address())
        .parameter(Instance.class)
        .parameter(DiagnosticHandler.class)
        .parameter(Handle.class)
        .build();

    // Destroy handler
    Object[] args = {instance, this, null};
    destroy.invoke(args);
}
```

This approach nicely reuses the existing framework rather than having to implement more FFM code from the ground up.

#### Callback

To build the diagnostic callback a new method is added to the existing class that provides the off-heap memory _address_ of the callback method itself:

```java
private record MessageCallback(Consumer<Message> consumer, Transformer<NativeStructure> transformer) {
    MemorySegment address() {
        var signature = MethodType.methodType(
            boolean.class,
            int.class,
            int.class,
            MemorySegment.class,
            MemorySegment.class
        );
        MethodHandle handle = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(MessageCallback.class, "message", signature);
        ...
    }
}
```

Note that again the signature of the callback must be hard-coded based on the documentation:

```java
public boolean message(int severity, int typeMask, MemorySegment pCallbackData, MemorySegment pUserData)
```

The resultant method handle is then bound to the callback _instance_ in order to delegate diagnostic reports to a specific handler:

```java
MthodHandle binding = handle.bindTo(this);
```

This handle is then linked to an up-call stub with a function descriptor matching the `message` method:

```java
private static MemorySegment link(MethodHandle handle) {
    var descriptor = FunctionDescriptor.of(
        JAVA_BOOLEAN,
        JAVA_INT,
        JAVA_INT,
        ADDRESS,
        ADDRESS
    );
    return Linker.nativeLinker().upcallStub(binding, descriptor, Arena.ofAuto());
}
```

The `build` method of the handler is modified to lookup the transformer for the message structure:

```java
public DiagnosticHandler build() {
    ...
    var transformer = (Transformer<NativeStructure>) registry.get(VkDebugUtilsMessengerCallbackData.class);
    var callback = new MessageCallback(consumer, transformer);
    var info = populate(callback.address());
    ...
}
```

And the address of the callback method is populated in the descriptor for the handler:

```java
private VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT populate(MemorySegment callback) {
    var info = new VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT();
    ...
    info.pfnUserCallback = new Handle(callback);
    return info;
}
```

A similar approach will be used when GLFW device listeners are reintroduced later.

#### Diagnostic Report

The last required change is to unmarshal the diagnostic report received by the `message` callback:

```java
public boolean message(...) {
    long size = transformer.layout().byteSize();
    var segment = pCallbackData.reinterpret(size);
    var data = (VkDebugUtilsMessengerCallbackData) transformer.unmarshal(segment);
    ...
}
```

Note that in this case the off-heap memory needs to be explicitly resized to match the expected structure.

Unmarshalling a structure field is essentially the inverse of the `marshal` method:

```java
record FieldMapping(...) {
    public void unmarshal(MemorySegment address, NativeStructure structure) {
        Object arg = foreign.get(address);
        Object value = transformer.unmarshal().apply(arg);
        local.set(structure, value);
    }
}
```

And similarly for the structure itself:

```java
class StructureMapping(...) {
    public void unmarshal(MemorySegment address, NativeStructure structure) {
        for(var f : fields) {
            f.unmarshal(address, structure);
        }
    }
}
```

Finally the following method instantiates a new structure instance and delegates to the unmarshalling code:

```java
record CompoundFieldMapping(StructLayout layout, Supplier<NativeStructure> factory, List<FieldMapping> fields) {
    public NativeStructure unmarshal(MemorySegment address) {
        var structure = factory.get();
        for(var f : fields) {
            f.unmarshal(address, structure);
        }
        return structure;
    }
}
```

Where the `factory` promotes the default constructor to a class member, since it is used both in this new code and previously to construct the field mappings.

Diagnostic handlers can now be attached to the instance as before, which is very useful given the invasive changes being made to JOVE.

A good test of the refactor is to temporarily remove the code that releases attached handlers when the instance is destroyed, which should result in Vulkan complaining about orphaned objects.

## Returned Parameters

### Returned Annotation

The next Vulkan component after the instance is the physical device which uses native methods that are highly dependant on by-reference parameters.  These pose a problem because by-reference and 'normal' parameters cannot be distinguished solely from the method signature.

JNA used the rather cumbersome `ByReference` interface which generally required _every_ structure to have _two_ implementations.  Additionally _every_ array is essentially a by-reference parameter as far as JNA is concerned, whereas we would prefer to separate the normal and by-reference cases.

A generic wrapper type could be introduced that would allow the framework to switch behaviour accordingly.  However the actual type of the reference would then not be known at runtime (due to type erasure) meaning the framework would be unable to build and validate a transformer when the library is created.

The most obvious solution is to implement a custom annotation to explicitly declare by-reference parameters and still have access to the actual reference type.

The annotation is a simple _marker_ interface with no declared functionality:

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.PARAMETER)
public @interface Returned {
}
```

Parameters returned by-reference are detected in the library builder when a native method is constructed:

```java
public NativeMethod build(Method method) {
    ...
    for(Parameter p : method.getParameters()) {
        boolean returned = Objects.nonNull(p.getAnnotation(Returned.class));
        builder.parameter(p.getType(), returned);
    }
    ...
}
```

The `parameter` method is overloaded to accept a flag indicating whether a parameter is returned by-reference:

```java
public Builder parameter(Class<?> type, boolean returned) {
    Transformer transformer = registry.get(type);
    signature.add(new Parameter(transformer, returned));
    return this;
}
```

Where `Parameter` is an internal record that composes a transformer and the flag:

The provided arguments are _updated_ after invocation of the native method:

```java
public Object invoke(Object[] args) {
    Object[] foreign = marshal(args, Arena.ofAuto());
    Object result = handle.invokeWithArguments(foreign);
    update(foreign, args);
    return returns.apply(result);
}
```

Where by-reference arguments are _overwritten_ with the unmarshalled data:

```java
private void update(Object[] foreign, Object[] args) {
    if(args == null) {
        return;
    }

    for(int n = 0; n < args.length; ++n) {
        if(signature[n].returned && Objects.nonNull(args[n])) {
            switch(signature[n].transformer) {
                case StructureTransformer struct -> struct.unmarshal(foreign[n], args[n]);
                case ArrayTransformer array -> array.update(foreign[n], args[n]);
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that the framework assumes that the argument or array has already been instantiated prior to the method call, i.e. `null` parameters or array elements are ignored.

### Integration

Using the new annotation the refactored library for the physical device is as follows:

```java
interface Library {
    int  vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(Instance instance, NativeReference<Integer> pPhysicalDeviceCount, @Returned Handle[] devices);
    void vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties(PhysicalDevice device, @Returned VkPhysicalDeviceProperties props);
    void vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures(Handle device, @Returned VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures features);
    void vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties(Handle device, NativeReference<Integer> pQueueFamilyPropertyCount, @Returned VkQueueFamilyProperties[] props);
    void vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties(PhysicalDevice device, VkFormat format, @Returned VkFormatProperties props);
    int  vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR(PhysicalDevice device, int queueFamilyIndex, Handle surface, NativeReference<Integer> supported);
}
```

Other than refactoring the library the remainder of the `PhysicalDevice` class remains as-is.

There are three by-reference use-cases to be addressed:

#### Structure

The `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures` method accepts a `VkPhysicalDeviceProperties` structure which is _populated_ by the native layer.

A new method is added to the structure transformer to copy the off-heap data back to the structure:

```java
public void unmarshal(MemorySegment address, Object structure) {
    for(FieldMapping field : mappings) {
        field.unmarshal(address, structure);
    }
}
```

Structures are the only type that can be returned in this manner, validation (not shown) applies this restriction in the `parameter` method above.

#### Handle Array

The `vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices` method enumerates the hardware devices by populating an array of handles.

The native method eventually delegates to the following code to populate the array:

```java
class ArrayTransformer {
    public void update(MemorySegment address, Object[] array) {
        for(int n = 0; n < array.length; ++n) {
            MemorySegment element = address.getAtIndex(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, n);
            array[n] = transformer.unmarshal(element);
        }
    }
}
```

As a quick reminder: Vulkan employs the [two stage invocation](/jove-blog/blog/part-2-triangle/devices#improvements) pattern when returning by-reference arrays:

```java
public static Stream<PhysicalDevice> devices(Instance instance) {
    Vulkan vulkan = instance.vulkan();
    VulkanLibrary lib = vulkan.library();
    VulkanFunction<Handle[]> enumerate = (count, devices) -> lib.vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, count, devices);
    Handle[] handles = vulkan.invoke(enumerate, Handle[]::new);
    ...
}
```

The slightly improved `invoke` helper (moved to the new `Vulkan` class) implements this pattern:

```java
public <T> T invoke(VulkanFunction<T> function, IntFunction<T> supplier) {
    // Determine the result size
    NativeReference<Integer> count = factory.integer();
    function.get(count, null);

    // Instantiate the container
    int size = count.value();
    T data = supplier.apply(size);

    // Invoke again to populate the container
    if(size > 0) {
        function.get(count, data);
    }

    return data;
}
```

#### Structure Array

Finally `vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties` returns a by-reference array of structures.

There is a subtle difference between a 'normal' structure array and one being returned by-reference.  Both cases require the off-heap array to be allocated as a contiguous memory block, however the memory layout of a by-reference parameter __must__ be a pointer (i.e. has an `ADDRESS` layout).

Therefore the following helper determines the actual parameter layout depending on usage:

```java
record Parameter(Transformer transformer, boolean returned) {
    private MemoryLayout layout() {
        if(returned) {
            return ValueLayout.ADDRESS;
        }
        else {
            return transformer.layout();
        }
    }
}
```

In either case the structure array is populated by slicing the off-heap memory and unmarshalling each element:

```java
public void update(MemorySegment address, Object[] array) {
    long size = transformer.layout().byteSize();
    for(int n = 0; n < array.length; ++n) {
        MemorySegment element = address.asSlice(n * size, size);
        array[n] = transformer.unmarshal(element);
    }
}
```

### Nested Structures

There is another 'hidden' use-case that only became apparent during refactoring of the physical device.  Each device supports a number of queue families which are retrieved during enumeration, described by the following structure:

```java
public class VkQueueFamilyProperties implements NativeStructure {
    public EnumMask<VkQueueFlag> queueFlags;
    public int queueCount;
    public int timestampValidBits;
    public VkExtent3D minImageTransferGranularity;
}
```

The `minImageTransferGranularity` field is actually a _nested_ structure which can be seen from the memory layout:

```java
public StructLayout layout() {
    return MemoryLayout.structLayout(
        JAVA_INT.withName("queueFlags"),
        JAVA_INT.withName("queueCount"),
        JAVA_INT.withName("timestampValidBits"),
        MemoryLayout.structLayout(
            JAVA_INT.withName("width"),
            JAVA_INT.withName("height"),
            JAVA_INT.withName("depth")
        ).withName("minImageTransferGranularity")
    );
}
```

In the native structure the `VkExtent3D` fields are essentially _embedded_ into the parent structure, whereas in the structure class this field obviously has to be an object reference (there is no analog of embedding in Java).  The structure transformer will need to support both _atomic_ fields (i.e. primitives and pointer types) and nested structures.

The code that walks through the layout is first modified to include all members except for alignment padding:

```java
return layout
    .memberLayouts()
    .stream()
    .filter(Predicate.not(e -> e instanceof PaddingLayout))
    .map(instance::mapping)
    .toList();
```

/////////////

```java
interface FieldMapping {
    /**
     * Marshals this field to off-heap memory.
     * @param structure     Structure
     * @param address       Off-heap address
     * @param allocator     Allocator
     */
    void marshal(NativeStructure structure, MemorySegment address, SegmentAllocator allocator);

    /**
     * Unmarshals this field from off-heap memory.
     * @param address       Off-heap memory
     * @param structure     Structure
     */
    void unmarshal(MemorySegment address, NativeStructure structure);
}
```

////////////

To accommodate nested structures the existing field mapping is converted to an interface which is a delegate for the different cases:

```java
private interface FieldMapping {
    void marshal(Object value, MemorySegment address, SegmentAllocator allocator);
    Object unmarshal(MemorySegment address);
}
```

This is composed into the following simple record type with the structure field handle (which is common to both cases):

```java
private record StructureField(VarHandle field, FieldMapping mapping)
```

The `mapping` function can now switch behaviour according to the layout of each field:

```java
private StructureField mapping(MemoryLayout member) {
    ...

    FieldMapping mapping = switch(member) {
        case ValueLayout _ -> atomic(field);
        case StructLayout nested -> nested(field, nested);
        default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException(...)
    };

    return new StructureField(handle(field), mapping);
}
```

The existing code is moved to a new field mapping implementation for atomic fields:

```java
private FieldMapping atomic(Field field) {
    PathElement path = PathElement.groupElement(field.getName());
    VarHandle foreign = layout.varHandle(path);
    Transformer transformer = registry.get(field.getType());
    return new AtomicFieldMapping(foreign, transformer);
}
```

A nested structure recursively builds the mappings for the embedded fields:

```java
private FieldMapping nested(Field field, StructLayout nested) {
    Class<?> type = field.getType();
    List<StructureField> fields = build(child, nested);
    Supplier<?> factory = factory(type);
    return new StructureFieldMapping(factory, fields);
}
```

Where `factory` looks up the reflected default constructor for a given structure type.

A second field mapping implementation for nested structures recursively marshals the embedded fields:

```java
private record StructureFieldMapping(Supplier<?> constructor, List<StructureField> fields) implements FieldMapping {
    public void marshal(Object structure, MemorySegment address, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
        for(var field : fields) {
            field.marshal(structure, address, allocator);
        }
    }
}
```

And similarly for unmarshalling:

```java
public Object unmarshal(MemorySegment address) {
    var structure = constructor.get();
    unmarshal(address, structure);
    return structure;
}

public void unmarshal(MemorySegment address, Object structure) {
    for(var field : fields) {
        field.unmarshal(address, structure);
    }
}
```

Note that the field is _overwritten_ by a new instance of the nested structure.

## Conclusion

This section covers the implementation of various edge-cases or features that were deferred above.

### Returned Arrays

A native method that returns an array is an edge-case for Java since the length of the resultant array cannot be determined from the return value itself.  Generally the length is provided separately, often as an integer-by-reference parameter in the same method.  Therefore a returned array __cannot__ be modelled as a Java array and must be represented by a new, intermediate type:

```java
public class ReturnedArray<T> {
    private final MemorySegment address;
    private final Registry registry;
}
```

Where `<T>` is the array component type.

The `get` method extracts the actual Java array given the length:

```java
public T[] get(int length, Class<? extends T> type) {
    ...
    return array;
}
```

The array is first allocated:

```java
T[] array = (T[]) Array.newInstance(type, length);
```

And then delegates to the relevant transformer to unmarshal the array elements:

```java
var transformer = (ArrayTransformer) registry.get(type.arrayType());
MemorySegment data = address.reinterpret(length * transformer.layout().byteSize());
transformer.update(data, array);
```

The new type has a companion transformer to plug into the framework:

```java
static final class ReturnedArrayTransformer implements AddressTransformer<ReturnedArray<?>, MemorySegment> {
    private final Registry registry;

    public Object marshal(ReturnedArray<?> arg, SegmentAllocator allocator) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }

    public ReturnedArray<?> unmarshal(MemorySegment address) {
        return new ReturnedArray<>(address, registry);
    }
}
```

Which is instantiated on demand in the `create` method of the registry:

```java
if(ReturnedArray.class.isAssignableFrom(type)) {
    return new ReturnedArrayTransformer(this);
}
```

The supported Vulkan extensions can now be retrieved from GLFW:

```java
public String[] extensions() {
    NativeReference<Integer> count = factory.integer();
    ReturnedArray<String> array = lib.glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions(count);
    return array.get(count.get(), String.class);
}
```

Notes:

* An unsupported component type will only be detected at runtime in the `get` method, but this seems acceptable given that the `extensions` method is the only such instance in the GLFW or Vulkan APIs.

* An invalid array length cannot be bounds checked since the off-heap memory must be resized using the unsafe `reinterpret` method, which can result in a JVM crash.
